Introduction to MongoDB
What is MongoDB?
MongoDB is a popular, open-source, NoSQL (Not Only SQL) document-oriented database that stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents rather than traditional rows and columns like relational databases. It's designed for scalability, flexibility, and ease of development.

Key Characteristics
1. Document-Oriented
Stores data as BSON documents (Binary JSON)

Each document is a self-contained data unit

Documents can have nested structures

Schema can vary from document to document

2. NoSQL Database
Non-relational

No fixed table structure

No SQL joins

Horizontal scaling capability

3. High Performance
Rich query language

Indexing support

Aggregation framework

In-memory processing capabilities
